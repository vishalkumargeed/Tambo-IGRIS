"Update the UI to include GitHub-style Octicons. Please use the following mapping for labels and tabs:

Title: PencilIcon (size 16, text-gray-500)

Description: NoteIcon (size 16, text-gray-500)

Conversations: CommentDiscussionIcon (size 16, text-gray-500)

Commits: GitCommitIcon (size 16, text-gray-500)

Files Changed: FileDiffIcon (size 16, text-gray-500)

Additionally, implement dynamic logic for the Checks icon based on the status:

Success: Use CheckCircleIcon (Color: text-green-600)

Pending/In Progress: Use DotFillIcon (Color: text-yellow-500)

Failure: Use XCircleIcon (Color: text-red-600)
 
Please ensure all icons are imported correctly at the top of the file and aligned with their labels using flex items-center gap-2.
